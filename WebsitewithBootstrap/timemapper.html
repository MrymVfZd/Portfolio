              <br />Have you ever wished you could make time feel longer or
              pause it so you could complete all your tasks? <br />
              TimeMapper is an app that you can use on your phone and watch to
              figure out how you'll use your time and then make plans to make
              the most of it. <br />Unlike other apps that keep you on task or
              count down your time, TimeMapper helps you create a schedule by
              keeping track of how you spend your time and then helps you manage
              it better!

                so many different application in the market each of which met
                part of user's needs. Considering time limitation, budget and
                resources, I decided to focus on what other applications lack
                and focus on strengthen their weakness.<br />
                So, I spend enough time to explore other applications( research
                phase) to come up with the best solution.

                A lot of us have really busy lives. We have to do many different
                things and try to make time for everything. But even when we try
                our hardest to plan our days, weeks, and months, we often can't
                finish everything we need to do. This can make us feel upset,
                stressed, and not happy.

                Although things like time management apps, to-do lists, and
                calendars can be useful, they don't solve everything. Instead of
                just checking off tasks, we should aim to come up with smarter
                and more complete solutions.

              <strong> Time Overlaping!</strong><br />
              When we examine the typical way users go about tracking and
              managing their time and tasks, everything seems fine until we
              encounter situations where time overlaps and multitasking become
              factors.<br />
              Users might find themselves doing two or more tasks
              simultaneously, like listening to a podcast while cooking, for
              instance. This raises questions about whether it's practical to
              record two tasks at the same time.<br />
              Additionally, we need to think about how complex it might be to
              generate reports that include overlapping time tasks from a
              technical perspective. In scenarios like this, especially in
              larger, real-world projects, it's important to prioritise these
              unusual situations by evaluating their importance to the
              business.<br />In my project, I made the decision to maintain a
              one-to-one relationship between tasks and times and intentionally
              avoided handling this exception due to the complexities it would
              introduce in report calculations and UI design. Instead, I
              concentrated on refining the main user workflow and enhancing the
              core user experience.
